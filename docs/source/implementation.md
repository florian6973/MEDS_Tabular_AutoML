# How does MEDS-Tab Work?

#### What do you mean "tabular pipelines"? Isn't _all_ structured EHR data already tabular?

This is a common misconception. _Tabular_ data refers to data that can be organized in a consistent, logical
set of rows/columns such that the entirety of a "sample" or "instance" for modeling or analysis is contained
in a single row, and the set of columns possibly observed (there can be missingness) is consistent across all
rows. Structured EHR data does not satisfy this definition, as we will have different numbers of observations
of medical codes and values at different timestamps for different patients, so it cannot simultanesouly
satisfy the (1) "single row single instance", (2) "consistent set of columns", and (3) "logical" requirements.
Thus, in this pipeline, when we say we will produce a "tabular" view of MEDS data, we mean a dataset that can
realize these constraints, which will explicitly involve summarizing the patient data over various historical
or future windows in time to produce a single row per patient with a consistent, logical set of columns
(though there may still be missingness).
