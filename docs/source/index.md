## Why MEDS-Tab?

MEDS-Tab is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the handling, modeling, and analysis of complex medical time-series data. By leveraging automated processes, MEDS-Tab significantly reduces the computation required to generate high-quality baseline models for diverse supervised learning tasks.

### I. Transform to MEDS

- Cost Efficiency: MEDS-Tab is dramatically more cost-effective compared to existing solutions
- Strong Performance: MEDS-Tab produces robust and high-performance across various datasets compared with other frameworks.

### II. Run MEDS-Tab

- Run the MEDS-Tab Command-Line Interface tool (`MEDS-Tab-cli`) to extract cohorts based on your task - check out the [Usage Guide](https://meds-tab--36.org.readthedocs.build/en/36/overview.html#core-cli-scripts-overview)!
  
- Painless Reproducibility: Use [MEDS-Tab](https://github.com/mmcdermott/MEDS_TAB_MIMIC_IV/tree/main/tasks) to obtain comparable, reproducible, and well-tuned XGBoost results tailored to your dataset-specific feature space!

By following these steps, you can seamlessly transform your dataset, define necessary criteria, and leverage powerful machine learning tools within the MEDS-Tab ecosystem. This approach not only simplifies the process but also ensures high-quality, reproducible results for your machine learning for health projects. It can reliably take no more than a week of full-time human effort to perform Steps I-V on new datasets in reasonable raw formulations!
